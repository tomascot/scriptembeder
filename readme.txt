Hello there!

This plugin was created to make adding JS script to your posts easy. Why? Because having to load a script in every page
is not good for anybody, that why with Script Embeder you can add scripts for each Post, and of course, the script is
loaded just in that Post (including selecting the order, and the position)

First Version:
Add multiple JS scripts (using the SRC or the script INLINE).
Select if the plugin is added to the HEAD or the FOOTER (using wp_head and wp_footer functions).
Select the order.

TODO (Next versions):
Add the scripts/styles using wordpress functions for that.
Better support for CSS. (it works now)
Allow uploading the file from the Post Editor. (low priority)
